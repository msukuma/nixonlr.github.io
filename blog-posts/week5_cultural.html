				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Peer Pairing </h3>
				<p id="date">07/27/2014</p>
				<p>I remember feeling a bit annoyed when I read that peer pairing was going to be a big part of my DBC experience. I'm really not the type that likes to solve problems with others. In fact, I would rather spend days trying to solve a problem on my own than seek help. To add to that, I tend not to trust team members. I remember periods in my academic life where I took on some of my group member's responsibilities out of fear that they would produce poor work. </p>

				<p>Since week 1, I've paired about 10 times and I must say that it has been one of the most rewarding experiences since I started coding. Most of the people I've paired with were competent and observing their way of thinking has allowed me to add new ways of approaching problems to my arsenal. Peer pairing has also forced me to work on something I don't always take seriously -people skills. I must admit that during my first few pairing sessions I was quite nervous. To me, it felt like solving the challenge was secondary to maintaining a lively social atmosphere.</p>

				<p>The hardest part for me about peer pairing has been giving feedback. Most of the pairing sessions I participated in felt good so trying to come up with actionable feedback for every pairing session hasn't been easy. At times, I found I've had to think very hard to come up with problems that really don't warrant much attention.</p>

				<p>As for the feedback I've received, I'm unsure of how to take it in. I know that most people are trying to give kind feedback so I feel that the ones I've received were more kind than honest. I a big proponent of feedback and am always looking for ways to improve but I can't say that the feedback I've received so far has been helpful. It's possible that the way people will give feedback in the future will change as the material gets harder and the course intensifies. Time will tell.</p>
