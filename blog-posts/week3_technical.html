				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> JavaScript in Web Development</h3>
				<p id="date">07/13/2014</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p class="head">History</p>
						<ul><li>Javascript was developped by Brendan Eich in the 90s out of a need to make webpages dynamic.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li><p class="head">Why has Javascript has gained so much popularity in recent times?</p>
						<ol>
							<li>It's easy to learn. </li>
							<li>Javascript code is executed on a user's processor instead of a web server thus saving the user the time and bandwidth that would have been consumed had all the processing been done on the web server.</li>
							<li>Javascript is a prototype language. This means that: 
								<ul id="dash">
									<li>objects can be defined and developed on the fly rather than having to build specific classes to meet specific needs.</li>
									<li>you can easily modify or extend the functionality of existing classes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>It's easy to debug using the browser's console or in Firebug.</li>
							<li>It has a lot of tools and is easily extensible.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><p class="head">Drawbacks</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Security
								<ul>Since javascript code is executed on the client's processor, it's easy for malicious code to reach end users and exploit their systems.</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Rendering
								<ul>Javascript could be interpreted differently by different browsers and thus produce different outputs. However, this can be avoided by testing how JavaScript renders on different browsers.</ul>
							</li>
