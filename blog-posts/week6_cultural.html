				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Stereotype Threat </h3>
				<p id="date">08/02/2014</p>
				<p>I just finished watching a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk" target="_blank">talk<a> by Claude M. Steele on identity and stereotype threat. If you've never heard of the term "stereotype threat" then ask yourself if you've ever felt anxiety about being judged stereotypically and negatively as a woman, black, or any other label that you identify with. If you have, then you've experienced the stereotype threat.</p>
				<p>I'm black and African and I don't give matters of race too much attention. It's always been my opinion that one's focus determines their reality. So, I was glad to hear Dr. Steele confirm that belief that the more you feel that your identity is important to you the more susceptible you become to the stereotype threat.</p>
				<p>Have I experienced this threat? I don't know, or should I say I don't think so. The threat manifests itself subconsciously thus even if you are experiencing it it's not a guarantee that you'll notice it. I mean how many movies, shows, ads, etc are out there that, purposefully or not, reinforce stereotypes? How do we know that they are not affecting us even if we consciously try to avoid their effects? So it's possible that I might have experienced the threat before but didn't notice. Nonetheless, I intend to keep trotting through this world knowing that I'm capable of anything.</p>
