				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Diversity in the Tech industry </h3>
				<p>A few months ago, Google released a demographic breakdown of its workforce, and with it unveiled something that has long been a problem in the tech industry - diversity. </p>

				<p>Of Google's U.S. based workforce, 61 percent are white, 30 percent are Asian, 3 percent are Hispanic, and 2 percent are African-American. Globally, only 30 percent of its employees are women, from which only 17 percent are technical staffers. When you break down the U.S. workforce as a whole, you find that it's 80 percent white, 12 percent African-American, and 5 percent Asian. Oh and 47 percent of workers are women. I find these statistics to be more reflective of the state of the tech industry as a whole than they are of Google. </p>

				<p>So, how can we solve this? If it were up to me, I would start by changing pop culture to reflect the changes I want to see in the tech industry I would also make people aware of the importance of technology and how it can be used to improve their lives. Lastly, I would address accessibility. It wouldn't make sense to create a desire for something and not provide the means to fulfilling it. </p>

				<p>All in all, I am very optimistic for the future. I see what's being done marketing wise to address diversity in the tech industry and firmly believe that it's only a matter of time until the bridges are gapped.</p>
