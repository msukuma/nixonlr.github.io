				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Stereotype Threat </h3>
				<p id="date">08/10/2014</p>
				<h4 class="head">When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind? </h4>
					<p>Happiest: Community, Autonomy, Close relationships, Community, Faith, Peace, Health </p>
					<p>Proudest: Commitment, Persistance, Will-power, Inspiration, Strength</p>
					<p>Most satisfied: Wealth, Self-reliance, Location, Money</p>
				<h4 class="head">What do I think of peace?</h4>
					<p>In my opinion, peace is one of the most coveted things in the world. It's possible that we go our whole lives trying to hold on to it or seeking it.</p>
				<h4 class="head">Values in my life</h4>
					<p>I live up to the values I've list up top except for Faith which I have lost.</p>
				<h4 class="head">What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h4>
					<p>A friend of mine asked me what I think she should do with her life. I asked her a question Allan Watts asked his audience during one of his many inspiring talks: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b0VKAifWDg">what would you like to do if money where no object?</a></p>
				<h4 class="head">Values and Stereotype threat</h4>
					<p>I have no doubt that my values will help me overcome any obstacles in my way. With respect to DBC, I am committed 100% and will will myself out of any feelings of inadequacy should they surface. I have already invested to much time and effort to consider giving up.</p>
