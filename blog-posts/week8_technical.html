					<h4 class="head"> What's a computer?<h4>
						<p>A computer is an object containing a <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/microprocessor.htm">microprocessor<a/> that accepts inputs and computes operations to produce outputs.</p>
					<h4 class="head"> What makes up a computer?<h4>
						<p>Most computers consist of a:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Case -- holds all of a computer's parts</li>
							<li>Motherboard -- is the primary circuit board inside your a computer. All components connect through the motherboard.</li>
							<li>Power supply</li>
							<li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) -- contains the microprocessor</li>
							<li>Random Access Memory (RAM) -- the CPU uses to store things as it computes opereations</li>
							<li>Drive -- used to store data that's not in use</li>
							<li>Cooling system -- cools the CPU</li>
							<li>Cables -- connect all the components</li>
						</ul>
					<h4 class="head"> Operating System<h4>
						<p>The operations system (OS) is that you use to control the computer after it boots. The OS is responsible for: </p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Memory management -- coordinates the flow of data in and out of RAM.</li>
							<li>Device management -- provides a software-based interface between the computer's internal components and each device connected to the computer like a keyboard or mouse.</li>
							<li>Storage management -- directs where data should be stored permanently on hard drives.</li>
							<li>Application interface -- provides data exchange between software programs that meet it's requirements and the PC. An application must be programmed to work with the application interface for the operating system you're using. This is why you see this in an application's requirements "Windows Vista or later," or "only works on 64-bit operating systems."</li>
							<li>User interface (UI) - provides a way for you to interact with the computer.</li>
						</ul>
