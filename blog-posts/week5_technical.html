					<p> So you've played countless games of Fifa 14 and have lost few, but crucial, tournament games because of some glitches that EA sports just hasn't addressed. So you are fed up and wish you could customize Fifa 14 to address those issues but just can't afford to wait on them. So you get a couple of Fifa addicts together and get to talking about designing the best soccer game ever created. The first subject on you group's long to do list is creating players and teams. You spend a night thinking about it and come up with a proposal. You propose creating class Player and within it a method that initializes all instances of class Player as follows:</p>
					<img src="images/classes1.png">
					<p>You explain that the funky variables that start with "@" are called instance variables and what that means is that any method we create within class Player will be able to access the values that those instance variables point to. </p>
					<p>You then explain that some methods will need to be created to access some information about the players you guys are going to create</p>
					
					<p> If your objective is to modify your input, then you might want to consider map!.</p>
