				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Variable Scope </h3>
					<p id="date">08/02/2014</p>
					<h4 class="head"> What is a variable's scope?<h4>
						<p> The scope of a variable defines where in a program the variable is accessible. Ruby supports 4 types of variables: local, global, instance, and class variables.</p>
					<h4 class="head"> Local variables<h4>
						<p>Local variables begin with a lower case letter or an underscore and can only be accessed within the construct they are defined in.</p>
						<img src="images/Week6/1.png">
						<p>Our display method returned an error saying that local variable 'four_characters' is not defined. We just defined four_characters above method display so why the error?</p> 
						<p>The scope of variables defined within method display starts after "def display" and ends at "end". However, variable "four_characters" is local to method display and different from variable "four_characters" which is defined outside the method even though they share the same name. So to fix the error we need to define variable "four_characters" within display:</p>
						<img src="images/Week6/2.png">
					<h4 class="head"> Global variables<h4>
						<p>Global variables must start with a "$" and are accessible from anywhere in your program.</p>
					<img src="images/Week6/3.png">
					<h4 class="head"> Class variables<h4>
						<p>Class variables start with "@@" and are shared among all instances of a class. So if one instance of a class changes a class variable, the change is reflected across all other instances of the class.</p>
						<img src="images/Week6/4.png">	
						<p>As you can see each new instance of Player changed @@player_count. </p>
					<h4 class="head"> Instance variables<h4>
						<p>Instance variables start with "@" and are similar to class variables except that their scope is limited to an instance of a class.</p>
						<img src="images/Week6/5.png">
						<p>Each call to player_count refers to a variable (@@player_count) shared across all 3 instances of Player, whereas each call to instance method name refers to a variable (@name) that's unique for each instance.</p>
