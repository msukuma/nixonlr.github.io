				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> SQL vs noSQL </h3>
					<p id="date">08/10/2014</p>
					<h4 class="head"> What's the difference between SQL and noSQL?<h4>
						<p>The major difference between these database management systems (DBMS) is in how they represent data. SQL databases do so in the form of tables and adhere to a schema definition. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are more flexible and can comprise of key-value pair, documents, graph databases, wide-column stores etc...</p>

						<p>NoSQL databases scale up horizontally because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)" target="_BLANK">auto-sharding</a> which allows NoSQL systems to automatically share data across servers thereby balancing the load across multiple servers. However, SQL databases scale up vertically, adding more and more traffic to a single server. </p>

					<h4 class="head"> So SQL or noSQL?<h4>
						<p>Which type of database system to use depends on your needs and expectations. You should ask yourself the following before deciding:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>How big a company are you?</li>
							<li>How many relationships and tables are going to make up your SQL database?</li>
							<li>How many lookups do you anticipate users will make daily?</li>
							<li>What data types will you be using?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you are big company like Google who uses complex data, and whose databases relationships and lookups range in the millions, then a noSQL DBMS will probably be your best choice.</p>
