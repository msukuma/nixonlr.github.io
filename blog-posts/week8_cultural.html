				<h3 id='mar_bord_pad'> Dealing with Conflict </h3>
				<p id="date">08/17/2014</p>
				<p>As I was reading DBC's instructions for this week's cultural blog I felt overwhelmed. I kept asking myself why would I reveal something so personal to the world? Without a doubt we've all felt shame and for most of us my guess is that it wasn't our finest hour. So why would I want to reveal that experience to a group of people I've never met? To be frank and honest, This is beyond my capabilities at this point in my life. I read a few of my cohort's blogs and I commend them for their courage. I just don't feel comfortable doing this. I can not explain it at the moment but something inside me has an extreme aversion to this idea. So I'll restrict this blog to how I've dealt with shame.</p>

				<p>I'm somewhere North West on the compass of shame. Sometimes I've lashed out, other times I've withdrawn. </p>
