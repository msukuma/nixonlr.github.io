			<p>As a soccer fanatic, I like that when I visit a sports news website I get the latest scores, transfer rumours, and plenty of highlights. ESPN Fc, does all that on its homepage and saves me the hassle of clicking through multiple links to get to my desired content. Visually, the website is bright, vibrant, and cluttered, but well organized, which makes finding what you want easy. If you love to watch match highlights or discussions, then you could spend hours on this website and never get bored since its content is constantly updated. </p><br><br>

		<p>I visit this site when I feel like spending an hour or two admiring some amazing photography.The site is just as beautifull and elegant as the pictures it hosts. I especially like the way the designers made use of color contrast and graphics to add to user experience.</p>

		<p>I'm on my Google plus website at least 20 times a day and always find something of interest to read through. The best part about the website is the manner in which the content is delivered to the user. I like how just by selecting a few interests the site can pull thousands of stories and deliver them to you in an endless stream of tabs to scroll through.</p>
